   We decided to model Kemps! using public announcements. Specifically, every time two cards are swapped, two announcements
   are made:

   <ol>
     <li>The discareded card is not being collected by the agent.</li>
     <li>The picked-up card is being collected by the agent.</li>
   </ol>

   Further, we implemented two different strategies:
   <ol>
     <li>A totally greedy strategy<br>The agent selects the value that is present the most in their first turn.
     The agent then tries to collect this value.</li>
     <li>A slightly informed strategy<br>The agent assumes that all cards are being collected by all players,
     until other evidence turns up. In such a scenario the agent excludes that card from the list of cards being collected
     by another agent. Then, the agent only considers collecting cards that are not being collected by anyone else.</li>
   </ol>
