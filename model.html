     <h2 style="text-align: left">Summary</h2>

   We decided to model Kemps! using public announcements. Specifically, every time two cards are swapped, two announcements
   are made:

   <ol>
     <li>The discareded card is not being collected by the agent.</li>
     <li>The picked-up card is being collected by the agent.</li>
   </ol>

   Further, we implemented two different strategies:
   <ol>
     <li>A totally greedy strategy<br>The agent selects the value that is present the most in their first turn.
     The agent then tries to collect this value.</li>
     <li>A slightly informed strategy<br>The agent assumes that all cards are being collected by all players,
     until other evidence turns up. In such a scenario the agent excludes that card from the list of cards being collected
     by another agent. Then, the agent only considers collecting cards that are not being collected by anyone else.</li>
   </ol>


     <h2 style="text-align: left">Model Formalization</h2>

     <h2 style="text-align: left">Public Announcements</h2>
     Each time a player picks up a card from the table and discards a card from their hand, two public announcements are
     made: one to describe which card was picked by which player and one to describe which card was discarded by which
     player. Each time a player achieves Kemps, a public announcement is made to describe which card number was part of
     the Kemps and which player has called out Kemps. <br><br>

     By using Public Announcement Logic (PAL) we give the agents a way to update their Kripke S5 models. When updating
     their Kripke models, the agent's can reduce the number of possible states in the model and also increase common
     knowledge in the game. <br><br>

    The public announcements made by the agents are always true and contain information which is accessible to every agent
     playing the game. Thus, after a public announcement of a message $\phi$, $\phi$ becomes common knowledge amongst
     all players of the game. <br><br>

     As the game progresses and more public announcements take place, the agent's receive more information about the real
     world which results in a decrease in the number of relations between possible states, and can also result in some
     possible states being eliminated. This allows a player to eliminate possibilities of who is or isn't collecting
     which cards from the deck, which again allows the agent to collect the card they think no one else is collecting in
     order to win and call Kemps. Thus, by incorporating announcements, we can introduce common knowledge in the Kripke
     model.

     <h2 style="text-align: left">Knowledge Base</h2>
     A knowledge base (KB) is constructed for the three players using the KnowledgeBase class. The KB of a player
     represents the knowledge/belief that the player has about every player during the game, including itself. The KB
     also has belief about which cards are/are not in every player's hand.

     The KB is initialized before starting the game by considering it possible that every other player has the cards the
     player can't see, i.e., the player only knows that the cards in their hand and the cards laid out on the table are
     not in any other players' hand. As player's pick up cards and discard them, the KB of each player is updated.


     <h3 style="text-align: left">Example: KB change due to a public announcement</h3>

     <h3 style="text-align: left">Example: KB change due to the table being reset</h3>

     <h2 style="text-align: left">Possible strategies for an agent</h2>
     <h3 style="text-align: left">Greedy</h3>
     In the greedy strategy, the agent only looks at the cards visible to it which are the cards in its hand and the
     cards on the table. The agent does not keep a KB of which agent has which card. The agent always picks the
     number(s) from the table which has the highest occurrence in their own hand and on the table. If there are no
     frequently occurring number(s) in the current round the agent makes no moves, otherwise the agent picks out the
     most frequently occurring number(s) and swaps them out with the least frequently occurring number(s) in their hand
     and on the table.
