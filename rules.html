     The game is played with a single deck of Poker cards without jokers, yielding 52 cards. In our version, three people play the game. <br>
     At the beginning of the game, each player receives four cards, which only that player can see, henceforth called hand cards.
     Additionally, 6 cards are displayed face up for all players to see, henceforth called table cards.
     The goal of the game is to collect four-of-a-kind as often as possible. An example of the game can be seen below: <br> <br>

     As indicated in the middle, it is currently the player's turn. During one's turn, one can swap as many hand and table cards as one wants.
     For example, the player may have noticed that there are three 9s accessible to the player. Then, the Queen and the 6 for example may be swapped with the two 9s in the table cards.
     <br><br>

     Once all swapping has taken place, it is the next player's turn. <br><br>

     Once a player has collected all four-of-a-kind, they collected a Kemps! and gain a point.
