     <h1 style="position: center">Game Explanation</h1>


    Traditionally, Kemps is a card game played in pairs with the goal of obtaining four cards of the same number and
     using a secret signal to get your partner to call out “Kemps!”. If this secret signal is intercepted by an
     opposing team, one of the team members can call out “Block Kemps!”. If the partner successfully calls out Kemps
     without Block Kemps, then their team wins a point, otherwise the team who calls out Block Kemps wins a point. If
     the partner calls out Kemps without their team member having the correct cards, then their team loses a point. The
     game ends when there are no more groups of four to be made. The winner is the team with the highest number of
     points. A round ends when a team scores a point. <br><br>

    The game starts by shuffling the cards and dealing four cards to each player. Each player holds a maximum of four
     cards in his or her hand at any given time.  Then, deal six cards to the middle of the table, face up. At the start
     of the round, each player can discard a card from their hand and then grab any card from the center of the table.
     There are no turns; players simply exchange single cards from their hand with cards that show up on the table.
     Here, to exchange cards means to first pick up a card from the table and then to discard a card from your hand.
     Once no player wants to pick up the cards from the table, new cards are dealt from the leftover deck, and the
     previous cards on the table are put into a discard pile. Once the leftover deck runs out of cards, the discard pile
     acts as the leftover deck and the game goes on until there are no more groups of four to be made. <br><br>

    Kemps is usually played with the standard card deck of 52 cards and two teams of two players. However, we have
     decided to simplify the gameplay:
    <ul>
        <li> We do not have teams in our implementation of Kemps, each player calls out “Kemps!” by themselves. This was
            done to simplify the implementation of the game since keeping track of secret signals in a computational
            manner would have been difficult. This means that the Block Kemps aspect of the game is also removed since
            it is intended to be used in teams. </li>
        <li> We also decided to remove the no turns aspect of the game and introduced a turn based gameplay so each
            player will only exchange cards from their hand and the cards on the table when it is their turn. This was
            done since it would have been difficult to implement reaction times of looking at the card and picking up
            the card. </li>
        <li> We restrict the game to three players. </li>
        <li> Since the Block Kemps aspect is removed, we still wanted a way for players to block other players from
            achieving Kemps. To do so we implemented a blocking strategy which is explained in
            <a href="https://riolu57.github.io/LAMAS/Technical_Report">Technical Report</a>. </li>
        <li> In our implementation, new table cards are laid out when in three turns, no player has picked a card from
            the table. This mimics the idea that no player wants to pick up the cards from the table during their turn.
            </li>
    </ul>

We decided to implement the gameplay in Python.

    <h1 style="position: center">Rules</h1>

     The game is played with a single deck of Poker cards without jokers, yielding 52 cards. In our version, three people play the game. <br>
     At the beginning of the game, each player receives four cards, which only that player can see, henceforth called hand cards.
     Additionally, 6 cards are displayed face up for all players to see, henceforth called table cards.
     The goal of the game is to collect four-of-a-kind as often as possible. An example of the game can be seen below: <br> <br>

      <p style="text-align: center">
          <img src="game.jpg" alt="Game overview"> <br>
      </p>


     As indicated in the middle, it is currently the player's turn. During one's turn, one can swap as many hand and table cards as one wants.
     For example, the player may have noticed that there are three 9s accessible to the player. Then, the Queen and the 6 for example may be swapped with the two 9s in the table cards.
     <br><br>

     Once all swapping has taken place, it is the next player's turn. <br><br>

     Once a player has collected all four-of-a-kind, they collected a Kemps! and gain a point.
