    <h1 style="position: center">Introduction</h1>

     The code for the project can be downloaded from:
     <a href="https://github.com/AndreeaMinculescu/LAMAS">https://github.com/AndreeaMinculescu/LAMAS</a> <br><br>

    We modeled the card game Kemps! in the context of Epistemic Logic using Public Announcements. Further, three different
     strategies are modeled and compared with each other in different scenarios. An explanation of how to play the game as a user can be found below.
     A more detailed descrition of how the game works can be found in <a href="https://riolu57.github.io/LAMAS/rules">Rules</a>.
     Additionally, for all specifics, please refer to <a href="https://riolu57.github.io/LAMAS/technical_report">Technical Report</a>.

     <h1 style="position: center">How to Play</h1>

     To play the game, run <a href="https://github.com/AndreeaMinculescu/LAMAS/blob/main/main.py">main.py</a>.
     The user interface in the form of a pygame window will show up.
     The game is played against two models that use epistemic logic to guide their strategy. The game is played as
     follows: the user always plays first and may pick however many cards from the table and discard an equal number
     of cards from the hand. Importantly, for each card picked from the table one card must necessarily be discarded
     from the hand (there must be 6 cards on the table and 4 cards in hand at each point during the game). To pick a
     card, the user must click on the desired card from the table cards and then click on one card to discard in
     exchange from the hand cards (the card clicking order is irrelevant as long as one card from the table cards
     and one card from the hand cards are selected consecutively). The user’s turn can take any amount of time and
     the only way to end the turn is by clicking on the “Next turn” button on the top left of the screen. In that
     case, the models make their moves in succession (see description of moves in the center of the screen). The cards
     are only changed if none of the three players change the table cards successively. Therefore, three "skipped" turns
     lead to new cards. We automatically check if the user has a Kemps, in
     which case a new set of hand cards is drawn and the score of the player is increased by 1. At the moment, we do
     not display the score on screen, but the final result after playing the game can be seen in the Python terminal
     used to run the game.
